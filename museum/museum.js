/**
 * A museum was represented by a square matrix that was 
 * filled with O, G, and W where O represented open space G
 * represented guards, and W represented walls. 
 * Write a function that accepts the square matrix and returns 
 * another square matrix where all of the O's in the matrix are 
 * replaced with the number of how many spaces they are away from a guard, 
 * without being able to go through any walls.
